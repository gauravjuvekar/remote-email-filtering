Introduction
============

``remote_email_filtering`` is a email client library that lets you use arbitrary
Python code for automation. You can write rules or filters as code on any
machine instead of being restricted to limited rulsets in hosted webmail or GUI
email clients.

As these actions are Python code, you can trigger other automation based on
emails.
